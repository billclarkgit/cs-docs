# Introduction

## What is CloudSure?

CloudSure is a cloud-native test automation platform that validates various functions of containerized, microservices-based applications on target cloud-native environments. CloudSure provides comprehensive testing capabilities to assess cloud-native functions' robustness, fault tolerance, and performance (such as AMF, SMF, and NRF) before deploying these mission-critical functions.

More specifically, CloudSure executes user-defined test scenarios to simulate real-world conditions and potential failure scenarios. These scenarios include network disruptions, infrastructure failures, and high traffic loads allowing users to validate the resiliency of their cloud-native functions under different stress conditions. Concurrently, CloudSure collects cloud-native metrics (e.g., Kubernetes) to monitor the impact on the 5G CNF and the cloud-native infrastructure. Lastly (and most importantly), CloudSure determines the impact on an extensive array of 5G KPIs (session, registrations, handoffs, etc.) measured by Spirent Landslide.

## Why CloudSure?

CloudSure provides 5G service providers with these key benefits:

- CloudSure focuses on resilience, ensuring that 5G cloud-native functions remain robust and reliable in challenging network conditions, enabling uninterrupted service delivery and reducing revenue loss.
- CloudSure minimizes operational costs by automating fault recovery and reducing service disruptions, allowing businesses to optimize resource utilization and maintain efficient operations.
- CloudSure enhances the customer experience by minimizing service disruptions, latency issues, and downtime, improving customer satisfaction and retention, ultimately providing a competitive advantage in the 5G market.
